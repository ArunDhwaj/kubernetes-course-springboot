1) Course: Kubernetes Course: SpringBoot and Google Cloud
============================================================

Description: Learn Kubernetes and Docker with Google Kubernetes Engine deploying Spring Boot Microservices


2) Learning Agenda
====================

2.1) Kubernetes,
2.2) Docker, 
2.3) Istio, 
2.4) Helm
2.5) Deploy Spring Boot and Spring Cloud Microservices to Kubernetes
2.6) Pre-requisite: Nope 


3) Kubernetes commands
========================

kubectl create deployment hello-world-rest-api --image=in28min/hello-world-rest-api:0.0.1.RELEASE
kubectl expose deployment hello-world-rest-api --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080


4) Required Tools
======================

- Java 8+
- Eclipse - Recent Version 
- Maven
- Git
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- ELB CLI
- Google Cloud Account



5) Learning: High Level Overview: Course Overview
================================================

Architectures are moving towards Microservices and Cloud. Docker makes it easy to containerize microservices. Kubernetes makes it easy to manage clusters with 1000's of 
containers running 1000's of microservices. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) makes it super easy to create Kubernetes Clusters. 

How about getting them all together and deploying Spring Boot Microservices to Kubernetes Clusters created on Google Cloud Platform using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)?

In this handson course, we will use Docker and Kubernetes to deploy a variety of Spring Boot Applications on Google Cloud using Google Kubernetes Engine:
- REST APIs - Hello World
- Todo Web Application War
- CCS and CES Microservices

You will implement Service Discovery, Centralized Configuration, Distributed Tracing and Load Balancing for Spring Boot Microservices deployed in Kubernetes Clusters.

You will learn to use Helm Charts, Istio Service Mesh, Google Stackdriver and Spring Cloud Kubernetes to play with Java Microservices on Kubernetes.

This course would be a perfect first step as an introduction to Kubernetes.

You will be using containerizing (using Docker) and deploying a variety of projects to Kubernetes Clusters. These projects are created with  Spring Boot (REST API Framework), Spring (Dependency Management), Spring Security (Authentication and Authorization - Basic and JWT), BootStrap (Styling Pages), Maven (dependencies management), Eclipse (Java IDE) and Tomcat Embedded Web Server. We will help you set up each one of these.
